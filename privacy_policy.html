<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App:</strong> NCTB Books 2025</p>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 25, 2025</p>

<div class="notice">
    <strong>Summary:</strong> NCTB Books 2025 provides PDF textbooks for NCTB (Classes 1–12). We respect your privacy. This policy explains what information we may collect, how we use it, and your rights. If you have questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:mmrrahman508@gmail.com">mmrrahman508@gmail.com</a>.
</div>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We aim to minimize data collection. Depending on how you use the app, we may collect the following types of information:</p>

<h3>1.1 Information you provide directly</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contact information:</strong> If you contact support or send feedback, you may provide an email address or other contact details.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional account data:</strong> (Only if your app offers a registration feature.) If you sign up, we will describe which fields are required at the time of collection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Automatically collected information</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device & usage data:</strong> We may collect device model, operating system version, app version, language, and anonymized usage metrics (pages viewed, features used). This data helps us improve the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash & performance data:</strong> If a crash occurs, we may collect crash reports (stack traces and device state) to diagnose and fix bugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Downloaded files (PDFs)</h3>
<p>PDF files you download are stored locally on your device. We do not access the contents of your downloaded files unless you explicitly share them with us (for example, via an in-app feedback or support feature).</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To operate, maintain, and provide the app and its features.</li>
    <li>To analyze usage and improve performance, features, and content.</li>
    <li>To respond to your support requests or communications.</li>
    <li>To detect and prevent fraud, abuse, or security incidents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We may use third-party services to help operate the app. These services may collect or process certain information on our behalf. Typical examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analytics & crash reporting (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase, Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry)</li>
    <li>In-app update and distribution services (Google Play)</li>
    <li>Advertising and monetization partners (if any)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each third party has its own privacy policy. Examples you might link to from your Play Store listing or app: <span class="small">Google Privacy Policy, Firebase Privacy Policy, AdMob/AdNetwork policies</span>. Replace the placeholders below with actual links used by your app.</p>

<h2>4. Ads & Monetization</h2>
<p>If the app displays ads, ad networks may collect information (e.g., device identifiers) to provide tailored ads. To opt out of interest-based advertising, follow your device or ad network settings instructions. If your app does not display ads, delete this section or state: <em>"This app does not display third-party advertisements."</em></p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain information only as long as necessary to provide the app and comply with legal obligations. Usage and analytics data are kept in aggregated/anonymized form unless otherwise required for troubleshooting or support.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>

    <li>Access – request a copy of personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Correction – request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
    <li>Deletion – request deletion of your personal data.</li>
    <li>Portability – request your data in a commonly used format.</li>
    <li>Objection or restriction – request restrictions on certain processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:mmrrahman508@gmail.com">mmrrahman508@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>NCTB Books 2025 is intended to provide educational material for school students. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age required by local law (e.g., 13 in many jurisdictions) without parental consent. If you believe a child’s personal information has been collected without consent, please contact us and we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect data from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Use caution when sharing personal information.</p>

<h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
<p>Information collected may be processed or stored in countries outside your own. By using the app, you consent to transfer and processing in those countries.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy occasionally. If we make material changes, we will notify you via the app or update the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
